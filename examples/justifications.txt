Justifications in use:

 = defn.1 @ ++ 1
 = defn.1 @ length 1
 = add_left_zero l2r @ + 1
 = defn.2 @ ++ 1
 = defn.2 @ length 1
 = add_assoc l2r
 = ASSUMPTION r2l @ ++ 1
 = defn.1 @ length 1
 = Arithmetic

3 components

1. law - name, defn of name, ind. assumption, case assumption
2. focus - tree descent numbers, ith inorder occurence of name
3. usage: whole law,left-to-right, right-to-left...





Justification has two parts, with the second being optional.

First part identifies the law
 = defn.n @ nm i
locate ith use of 'nm', and apply nth clause in its definition

 = lname dir @ nm i
locate ith use of 'nm', and apply law 'lname' in specified 'dir'
dir in {l2r,r2l}

= lname dir
apply law 'lname' in specified 'dir' at top-level

= ASSUMPTION dir @ nm i
locate ith use of 'nm', and apply inductive hypothesis in specified 'dir'
